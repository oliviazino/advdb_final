          This platform was created to help students stay informed and involved in dorm-hosted events
          across Notre Dame’s campus. With so many fun, meaningful, and community-building activities happening
          every week, we wanted a central place to highlight them all — organized by dorm.

          Campus Connect was designed by students, for students, with the goal of making campus feel smaller,
          more connected, and more engaging.
